# During session
- Started implementation on a waiting system for one range-based-question component to wait for the user to select an answer before continuing to the next question. Firstly, I got all the range based questions from the database and displayed them with a loop.
    * I started with thorough research on different ways of accomplishing this. References to sites that I used and helped me will be below.
    * Started with creating an empty API Controller, DataController (refer to data_controller.png). This was originally used to hold functions to get a list of specific data that will be used in the code, such as GetAllRangeQuestions(), however after creating services this may not be required anymore. I decided to still keep it incase we need it.
    * I created the Services folder with RangeQuestionService that will enable me to get a list of all range questions from the database as an IEnumerable<RangeQuestion> using the function GetAllRangeQuestions(). This knowledge will be useful in the future because we will need to create services for all other data taken from the database, for example Jacob will need to create one for TextAnswers. (refer to service.png).
    * Using the GetAllRangeQuestions() function through the service, I got all the range based questions in a list on the main QuestionPage in the OnInitializedAsync() so that it loads right as the page opens. Then created a foreach loop that created an RBQuestion component for each RangeQuestion. (refer to question_page_1.png)
    * The RBQuestion component takes in a RangeQuestion object as a parameter and displays the question text and question number using the id. (refer to rb_question_component_1.png)
