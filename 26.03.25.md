# During session
- Added encouraging messages
    * The client requested some encouraging messages to be displayed throughout the questionnaire to keep the candidate interested in our sprint one client meeting. I started with creating a formula that indicates how often a message will be shown throughout the questionnaire based on the total number of questions, (message-calculation.png). I decided the messages should be 25% of the entire questionnaire, after debating between a few percentages. I took 25% of the total number of questions to determine how many questions there will be between each message; these are the sections. The total number of questions divided by the number of sections gives us the frequency of the messages. This will be how often these messages will appear, after how many questions. For example if the frequency is 5, then a message will appear every 5 questions on the fifth one.
    * Jada helped me with searching for some typical encouraging messages on google that she added to the database while I created the EncouragingMessagesService to obtain them and use with my formula. 
    * After testing, I added some styling to the messages, adjusted their position on the page, and added a slight fade-in affect to make it less overstimulating for the user.
- Help Jada with user authentication
    * I joined Jada on a call with Arian, our student helper, to try and set up the user authentication for the website. We set up Microsoft Identity package to make it easier to manage the user roles and permissions to the pages. 
    * I helped with creating the LoginModel, RegisterModel, and NextUser class to help with authentication. Furthermore, created the new migrations that ran the new user tables created by the Identity package to update our database, (example of migration in example-migration.png).

# Issues
- Jada and I had one main issue with setting up the user authentication. It was a context problem with our EditForm elements in the login pages, (edit-form-error.png). Our first idea was to add an EditContext property to the EditForm (solution-one.png), however, it did not work. We instead got a new error shown in edit-form-error-2.png. With some help from the student helper, we managed to fix it by adding <DataAnnotationsValidator /> at the beginning of the EditForm.
