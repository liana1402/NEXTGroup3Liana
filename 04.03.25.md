# During session
- I implemented the changes mentioned in the previous session and got it to work successfully. It is now more efficient and smoother.
    * I first commented out all the code in questionsPage and RBQuestion. I moved the form code over into the loop on questionsPage and deleted the RBQuestion component all together. 
    * I added the currentQuestionIndex to the RangeQuestionService to store as the page refreshes.
    * I edited the functions on questionsPage to match with the current setup of the loop. Such as increasing the currentIndex once the button is pressed.
    * To prevent showing all questions at once, I added an if statement into the loop that will only run if we are on the currentQuestionIndex.
