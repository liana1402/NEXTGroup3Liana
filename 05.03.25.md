# During session
- I started to merge the text and range based questions together. First I took Jacob's code and went through it with him to make sure we are on the same page. Then I started to incorporate his code with mine.
    * I added the text questions component into the for loop and added the total length of both question lists as the maximum number of loops. 
    * I moved his OnInitialize code into the other one to keep it all in one function. 
    * I also incorporated the currentQuestionIndex into the TextAnswerService similar to mine. 
    * To prevent confusion between the two question types and which one to print first, I added a boolean to rangeQuestionService indicating weather or not we are on the text based questions. Once the if statement for range questions is completed, in the else statement, the boolean is set to true. The text based statement will only run if that boolean is set to true.

# Issues
- After adding all the changes above, there are still some difficulties with running the code. Theoretically, it should have ran the range questions with no problem and I was expecting to have some changes made once it got to the text questions. However, when I ran the code, both question types were loading onto the screen and the next button did not work. This was very confusing as I set the boolean for exactly that reason. This issue will be further investigated in the next session.
