# During session
- Discuss range-based questions used in the questionnaire
    * We paired up and created 4 questions each comparing a set of departments for each question that are based on the research done in the previous weeks. The research used was on role requirements found on the NEXT career site noted in the client research document.
    * Jada and I created 4 questions relating to being detail-oriented, collaborative, being familiar with web design, and being a leader. Each of these compare a list of departments to each other and add points to the selected side.
- Jada and I discussed the admin adding a new role if a new job opens up applications. The system will ask for the role name, department to add it to, a description that will be used for the text-based question.
- Started C4 diagram, Jada and I worked on the context diagram.
- Updated the use case diagram to include guest starting the questionnaire and admin being able to add roles.
