# During session
- Started with a detailed plan of the day as we were very tight on time. 
    * Morning: connect the result information to the dashboard in the form of charts, completing the user profile page on candidate dashboard, completing the cookie agreement.
    * Afternoon: start writing the test plan and start testing 
- Add cookie service
    * After Jada completed the front end of the cookie agreement, I created a CookieService that stores whether or not the user has clicked agree. This will prevent the pop-up showing up every time they open the home page and if in the future, there will be more customisation with the cookie agreement. The user's choice will be stored in the service while the session is open. 
    * I finished off the cookie agreement with adding a little css to hide or show the pop-up and to enable or disable the 'start quiz' button depending on if they clicked agree
- Some issues came up with time-management on one of the tasks that was meant to finish in the morning (view in issues section). As a reaction to this issue, I created a new plan for the rest of the day. This was a decisive on-the-spot plan to come back from this setback. I reallocated tasks, I wanted to have two people work on the charts and completing the dashboard, however, the team member working on that task did not want help and insisted on doing it themself. So I trusted that they will finish it by the end of the day. The rest of us started on the testing plan.

# Do before next session

# Issues
- We had some issues with the amount of work being completed, some tasks were not completed on time today that pushed back the schedule. The charts that connected the result data to the dashboard were started on Monday and needed to be complete by this morning latest as we were behind schedule, however, the teammate assigned for this task could not complete it by the agreed time and would not ask for help or communicate their struggles. This resulted in a push-back of the schedule as we could not start the testing on dashboard pages until this was complete.
