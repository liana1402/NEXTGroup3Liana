# During session
- Sprint overview
    * I started with giving an overview of the sprint plan and getting everyone's feedback. It helped allocate the roles to each person based on what their strengths are, (Refer to sprint-whiteboard-1.png and sprint-whiteboard-2.png for an example).
- Backend of the results page
    * While waiting for Jacob to complete the functions, I started with the results page component. I created a result component and added it to the question page. I wrote the functionality that makes it only show if all questions have been answered, (results-component.png). 
    * The component uses data from the saved result object in the ResultService. I added the function that calculates the top roles and top department in questionPage and passes it to the component due to some issues with using the service functions inside the component. The service was not accessible through the component. 
    * The result page then loops over the top roles list to display them; this creates a flexible backend in case the client would want to display more or less than 3 roles, (results-roles-display.png). However, the primary role is displayed separately because of the different styling and priority. 
    * Due to not having enough time, we weren't able to create a web scrapper that gets links to the NEXT careers website for the vacancies of the selected roles. So, I compromised and created a custom link that opens the NEXT careers vacancies page with the selected role input in the search bar, (custom-link.png).
