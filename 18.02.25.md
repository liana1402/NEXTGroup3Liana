- Me and jacob went through the database and matched the models to the tables. Some models contain List members and are not able to be stored as lists in the database. 
    * For example the Result model contains a list of department points role points. These need a way to reflect in the database. I created a Serializing and Deserializing function for each list that will enable us to store the points as a string in the database and convert it to a list in the code (refer to serialization_functions.png). At first, I stored the points as a tuple with List<(int Point, string Department)> DepartmentPoints. However, I changed it to it's own Point class because I thought it was causing some issues with the functions. This might be changed back to a tuple to minimize creation of unnecessary objects.
    * I also validated the tables included in the AzureContext file with the database tables as we were having some errors with the "Roles" table not being found from the database, however "Roles" is only a model for the collection class of "Role" and not supposed to be a database table.
