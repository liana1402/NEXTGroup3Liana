# During session
- Add initial department selection
    * I added an initial department selection question before the range questions to give the candidate an option to boost some departments up for a more personalised result. This will not confirm that the final department will be what the candidate selected if their questionnaire answers do not match, however, it will help their result if they do move towards that path with their answers, (initial-department-selection.png). 
    * I then added the styling on this question.
- I merged the final implementation of range and text questions and solve merge conflicts.
- I lead our final discussion and plan on sprint week to ensure everyone is clear on their tasks and prepare if needed.
