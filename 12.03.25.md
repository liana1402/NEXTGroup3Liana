# During session
- Finish implementation of range questions
    * There was a question about what would happen if the user keeps selecting neutral. Based on the current functionality, nothing would have points and the text questions will get the default first department in the list, however, this would not be accurate to the user. So, I decided to add points to all the departments that are neither in the left nor right list (case 2 in add-department-points.png). This would result in a department being taken to text questions that still fits the options of selecting neutral for all questions.
    * I went through and testing all possibilities with range questions and everything worked as expected. I pushed it over to the github and completed the first section of the questionnaire.
