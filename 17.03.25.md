# During session
- I went through the database and evaluated if all departments have equal chance of being selected so that the final result is as accurate as possible. I counted how many times each department is connected to a question and compared the results. My conclusion was that Merchandising, Trading, and Design needed three more mentions each. As a response, I started writing three more questions that compared the three of them to each other, (extra-questions.png). This created more balance between departments and more chances of getting the closest match.
