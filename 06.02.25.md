# During session
- Jada and I finished the context diagram as part of C4 level 1. We Modified and confirmed the descriptions of each connection with the use case diagram. 
- Lead the discussion on next week's plan on how the code will be split. We will start with the Department, Role, and Roles models along with the controllers and views for those models (for reference view week_4_code_prep.jpg). I wrote the structure based on our class diagram; starting with the department and role next week to have a good base to work with on sprint week.
- Presented my thoughts on a change in the class diagram
    * Previously, the departmentPoints member in the Results class was a List of integers. I suggested it be an enum like the rolesPoints because we need a way of connecting the department to the points. It would create an extra step of comparing the int to another list of departments if it stays at a List. After discussion, we agreed to convert it to an enum or departments.
- Discussed the structure of our github branches
    * Agreed each branch will be made and dedicated to a feature we are all currently working on and a new branch will be created for updates.

# Do before next session
- I will update the week 4 plan in the group work diary based on our discussion on the code prep. This will help us stay on track and have a smoother coding process.
