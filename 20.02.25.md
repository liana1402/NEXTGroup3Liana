# During session
- Swapped the default home page to the QuestionPage.
- Continued implementing the waiting system. Researched more on communication between components and being able to send values, decided to continue with the EventCallback feature in Blazor.
    * Added a current question index to keep track of the questions so that the page can refresh after each component is done being answered.
    * Added an async and await function, HandleAnswerSelected, that will wait for the component to send feedback. This function will be used as an EventCallback parameter in RBQuestion. (refer to questions_page_code_section.png)
    * In the RBQuestion component, an async and await function will be used on the submit button, NotifyAnswerSelected, that will invoke the EventCallback to notify the parent component that the button has been pressed. In the QuestionPage, the loop will continue and the next RBQuestion component will be shown. (refer to rb_question_component_code_section.png)
    * I did some more research on the radio buttons and found it easier to use the built-in Blazor components of InputRadioGroup and InputRadio. 
    * I encountered an issue here because every time the page refreshed, the CurrentQuestionIndex will revert back to 0. (explained in issues section below)
    * After setting up session storage, the page refreshes and stores the previously selected answer successfully. I tested this using the console to show my selected answer.
- We had our client meeting for sprint one feedback. While Jada was explaining our concept and the whole project, I was taking notes on the feedback. Then I took over and explained the backend and how the code is going to work with the point system and what happens when a user selects an answer. (refer to client_feedback.png)

# Issues
- The issue I encountered with CurrentQuestionIndex resetting after the page refreshes was solved with session storage. I researched the problem and came across two options, using local storage or session storage. I went with session storage because it will not be stored if the user closes the page and opens it up again. It is not necessary for our program to save that data once the page is closed. I downloaded the required packages through the console with "dotnet add package Blazored.SessionStorage". Then I added the async function SaveCurrentQuestionIndex that sets the CurrentQuestionIndex and OnAfterRenderAsync that gets the CurrentQuestionIndex. These functions work with an instance of ProtectedSessionStore injected at the top of the code file.
