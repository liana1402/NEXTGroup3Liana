# During session
- leaded the discussion on the client's answers from monday's meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page and we all understood the goals
    * I read out each question and, one by one, everyone explained their understanding of the client's answer
    * If there was any conflicting opinions, we started a discussion
    * Example of conflicting understandings was with the timer for aanswering the questionnaire. Two people understood it as 5 mins for each question and others as 5 mins for entire questionnaire. After further discussion, we agreed to continue with 5 mins for entire questionnaire but to clarify in the next meeting with the client.
- Started and completed wireframe for candidate and staff dashboards (images added as candidate.png and staff.png)
- Valuable discussion on the points system for each question 
    * Two types of questions will be implemented: range-based (user selected from a range of strongly agree to strongly disagree) and text-based (user selects from 4-5 text answers that match them the best)
    * After many ideas and a thorough discussion, we agreed to continue with each department starting at 0 points and gaining either 8 or 4 points depending on the question.
    * range questions compare two or more departments on each side of the range spectrum (such as comparing creative and technical departments). If the user selects strongly agree, it will add 8 points to the departments on that side, and vice versa. If they select agree, it will add 4 points. The purpose of range questions is to narrow down the general departments by going through all of them and adding points to each.
    * Then text-based questions are answered to narrow down to roles in the top 2 departments selected from range questions. Each answer in the text-based question in connected to one role and only that role's points go up by 8 if that answer is selected, the other roles in the department of the answered question will go up by only 4.
    * At the end, the candidate is left will top 3 roles with the highest score and a suggested department.

# Do before next session
- Start class diagram and complete first draft to discuss in next meeting

# Issues
- Miscommunication with Jacob about how departments will be connected to range-based questions in the ERD.
    * Due to no way of visualizing our points with a marker and whiteboard, it was difficult for me to understand Jacob's opinion on how the link table should be for question and department. He suggested we add a boolean to each department connected to a range question clarifying if it is on the agree or disagree side of the range. I suggested it will be easier to write it in the code as the question is being generated because it will not be too difficult and might take too much database storage to store a boolean for every single department connected to a range-based question and it would limit the department combinations for each question as we will only be able to stick to what we added to the database.
    * My understanding of Jacob's idea was that we have both departments in the table and add a boolean to them, which I found a bit redundant. However, he meant we have it in a link table where the question_Id and only one department_Id are stored with a boolean indicating which side of the range it will be on. 
    * This experience has shown me that using visuals to present ideas are very important and I will be bringing a whiteboard marker to meetings from now on.
