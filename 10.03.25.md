# During session
- Combine range and text questions 
    * Once Jacob finished the backend on text based questions, excluding the point system, I started with merging his code into mine to combine range and text questions and start implementing the flow of answering questions. 
    * I added some validation to create a smoother transition to the text questions. Such as a variable in the RangeService to check if the user is on the text questions. This will make it easier to determine which section of code to display.
    * Once this was merged, I pushed it and it allowed us to branch and start working on the point systems of our respective question types.

# Do before next session

# Issues
- I had to work on modifying the code as a result of merge conflicts between range and text questions. For example, I removed the component for text questions and made it similar to the implementation of range questions with help from Jacob.
