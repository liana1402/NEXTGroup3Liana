# During session
- Organize the plan after sprint. My tasks will be:
    * Merge the layout of range and text questions to work in the expected manner. Text questions should start after range questions are completed.
    * Incorporate the point system on range questions. Be able to receive a list of departments with points at the end of each question.
    * Merge final implementation of range and text questions to begin testing and debugging in sprint 2.
- The rest of this week will be used to work on the STAR report and cool down from sprint week.
