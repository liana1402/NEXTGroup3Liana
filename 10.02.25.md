# During session
- Started creating the branches and project in blazor. 
    * We started by creating a dev branch out of main and smaller branches off dev for the features being currently implemented. Today we worked on the dep-role-roles-setup branch to start the implementation of department, role, and roles classes. 
    * After helping with the setup of branches, my next task would require the models to be made, so I started on doing some deeper research into web scraping. It was brought up in one of our earlier meetings about how to get the roles and departments from the NEXT website. I researched and tested web scraping using this website: https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-c-sharp#how-to-scrape-in-csharp 
    (testing_web_scraping.png for sample code)
    (NEXT_website_scraping.png for how I got the querySelector item names)
    * Although I was successful with retrieving the role titles from a search page, it would be difficult to link new roles to the questionnaire if not done manually, which is how we have it setup currently. This research might be useful in the future of this project if we decide to move forward with that method instead.

# Do before next session

# Issues
- There were many issues while we were making the branches and sharing the files with one another. We needed to remake the branches and files multiple times before we could start coding. The first time, we created the branches before we added the blazor project to main, therefore had to delete the branches, then I created the project on my device and commited to main, and finally we created the branches. The next few times my teammates tried to access the files, the 'Models' folder was locked and not opening. This caused us to remake the files and start over. Luckily, these issues were happening while we have not started the code and before the sprint week. Meaning by then, we will get the hang of using the branches and sharing files properly.
