# During session
- Frontend of the results page
    * With the data successfully being displayed on the results page, I made a simple sketch of how the data would be laid out and got some opinions from the group. 
    * There was some difference in opinion about how the roles would be displayed, I suggested them being in a row rather than listed because, as stated by the client our sprint one meeting, the roles should not seem like a tiered list and more as options to choose from. Another teammate thought it should be in a column format that looks more like a list. After some discussion from the team, we went with the current layout where the primary role is amplified, however, the roles are not presented in a specific order of most matched.
    * I modified the department descriptions as well, taking them from the NEXT careers website department descriptions.
    * I connected the buttons at the end to create and account or login to the respective pages.
    * The final results page is now complete, (final-result-page.png).
