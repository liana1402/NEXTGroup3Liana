# During session
- I started creating the migrations for the current views created (Department, Role, Roles). After Jacob and Jada merged the models they created, I pulled their code into a branch called "department-role-roles-views" and created a migrations folder to be able to view their pages on the website. 

# Do before next session
- Research on Azure to prepare for setting up the database in the sprint
- Write a detailed plan for sprint week

# Issues
- After creating the migrations, the pages threw an error and would not open (refer to page_error.png). We predict this may be because of the confusion with using a local database. Through merging code from 4 different devices, the reference to local databases might have messed up and it can no longer find the appropriate server.
    * We tested creating a new model on my device from scratch on this project and on a new empty project, it still threw an error on this project, however, worked on the new empty project.
    * I checked my local database and the department and role tables were all there and contained the correct data meaning there is no problem with the local database.
    * These tests made us believe that it might be an issue with all members using local database.
    * We have modified the plan to implement an Azure database before we continue further with the project.
