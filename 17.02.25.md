# During session
- Discussed the sprint plan with the group and updated the group work diary
- Jasmine and I started creating the User classes while the rest were setting up the Azure database
    * I created the Candidate, Staff, and Admin models that inherit from the User parent class using the class diagram
    * We are not creating the CRUD pages until the database is completed
- I helped Jada with creating the migrations for the database through her terminal
    * added a new migration called Initial which added the migrations folder
    * used this page as a reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/managing?tabs=vs
- After Jada and Jacob completed the database, I completed the views and routes and confirmed the migrations for Department, Role, and Roles to finalize the branch dep-role-roles-setup and merge it into dev.
- Jasmine and I started creating the question models
    * we added a new branch called question-setup to start creating the Question, RangeQuestion, and TextQuestion models
    * I created the TextQuestion and TextAnswer models using the class diagram
- Installed Azure Data Studio on desktop to be able to view the database tables (refer to azure_data_studio.png)
