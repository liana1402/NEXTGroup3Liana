# During session
- Implement point system on range questions 
    * I started with drawing out a simple illustration of the backend of range questions and how the points will be distributed, (department-point-sketch.png). A range question object has a list of Point objects, where Point.Id is the department-point-sketch.png Id and Point.points is the amount being added, on the left and right side which is determined by the DepartmentRangeQuestion link table. The answer selected by the user will determine which list gets points added and how much specifically.
    * I used a switch statement that goes through each type of answer and determines how much points are added to which list, (add-department-points.png).
