# During session
- After starting the testing plan yesterday, Jada and I proceeded with the lighthouse review of the landing and questions pages while Jasmine took over continuing the testing plan. We gave screenshots of the lighthouse report to Jasmine and a list of things we need to change to improve the score, (lighthouse-report.png).

- Clean up dashboard CRUD pages
    * After providing some info to Jasmine for the test plan, Jada and I continued to clean up the code on dashboard pages. We went through and decided which CRUD pages need to be visible for which user type and adjusted the links on the side menu. 
    * Candidates can view their profile details, and edit or delete their account.
    * Staff can only view their profile details, and all CRUD pages on questions, departments, and roles. We did not add a way of adding new departments because of the nature of our range questions; they would need to state which side of the range question the department would fall under if any. In the future we could use an AI that will determine that. 
    * An admin can view all the same pages as staff as well as staff CRUD pages. However, no other user type can view candidate info due to the privacy policy given by NEXT.

# Do before next session

# Issues
- Continuing with the issue from yesterday, charts were still not implemented at the end of the day. The teammate responsible for this task lacked communication to let us know if there were any problems with implementing the charts onto the dashboard page. This is a step back because we plan on working on the presentation and finishing testing on dashboard pages before the final presentation, however, it will all need to be postponed. We were disappointed with the contribution and efforts from that team member, especially as they left the meeting early without completing their work. We expect them to complete it over the weekend.
