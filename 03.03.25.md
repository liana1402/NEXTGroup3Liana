# During session
- Although the waiting system works on range based questions, the efficiency is not great. After the user clicks next, the page refreshes to the first question for a second and then refreshes back to the actual question number. My main goal is to find out why this is happening and stop it. 
- After talking with the student helper and lecturer in this session, I have decided to reimplement the range based questions waiting system and remove the component and event callback method as that might be causing this problem. 
- Next session, I will implement the new techniques we discussed and test if it works. I will remove the component and move it over to the main page in a loop. I will move the current question index to the service to store it even when the page refreshes (I learned this is possible from the student helper), and therefore, will remove the session storage all together.
