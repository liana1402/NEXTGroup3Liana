# During session
- Reviewed client questions with the group and edited the wording to make it easier to read.
- While Jada asked the client questions, I was responsible for writing meeting notes throughout the whole meeting and the client answers to our questions.

# Do before next session

# Issues
- We did not have enough time to get all our questions answered by the client. We hope to be able to have one on one time with the client to go through our current work and answer some more questions.
